# rbxbin

Go package providing routines to deploy, install and fetch Roblox programs (referred to as Binary)
Package [`log/slog`](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog) is used by some routines for logging purposes.

Binaries WindowsStudio, MacPlayer and MacStudio do not have guranteed support, as this package
is directed towards Windows support. Feel free to contribute.
